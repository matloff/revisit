As recounted in <A HREF="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/348600-trump-touts-3-percent-economic-growth-takes-shot-at-obama">The Hill</A>, President Trump stated the following on August 30, 2017 in a speech on tax reform in Springfield, Missouri:
<p>
"We just announced that we hit 3 percent in [gross domestic product]. It just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration during an eight-year period never hit 3 percent, so we're really on our way".
<p>
The Hill article goes on to explain that, under Obama, the economy hit or surpassed 3 percent growth during numerous quarters, but never sustained that level of growth for a full year.  Hence, the immediate motivation for this example was to look at Trump's claim and to see to what extent it appears to be accurate and/or misleading.  A secondary motivation was to create a program that could be used to look at the latest GDP data for future analyses.

 As can be seen above, the closest that GDP came to 3 percent during a calendar year (January 1st through December 31st) during Obama's eight years was 2015 when it hit 2.86 percent.  However, it did surpass 3 percent during four consecutive quarters 4 times, in the four-quarter periods ending in 2010 quarter 3, 2014 quarter 3, 2015 quarter 1, and 2015 quarter 2.  Trump has only one four-quarter period during which GDP increased 2.25 percent.  It did surpass 3 percent in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2017 but then GDP surpassed 3 percent in 8 quarters under Obama as well.  Hence, saying that "the last administration during an eight-year period never hit 3 percent" and that "we hit 3 percent" is comparing annual calendar figures with quarterly figures.  It is essentially comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.
